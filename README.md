My Story
---

I knew I wanted to be a Software Engineer even before I realized that I would have to cram chemical equations to study Software Engineering at a University. Since my early university days, I taught myself Programming and Data Structures and Algorithms, even before formally introduced by the university and started taking part in competitive programming.

During the summer break after my Sophomore year, I decided to stay back at the University and attend a summer workshop on Machine Learning taken by a professor. Then there was no going back.

I started building incredible Machine Learning Models and Applications around it. Within 45-days of taking the workshop, I cracked into the finals of a Hackathon, which saw ~25 teams in the finals that initially had more than 2200 participants at the start! I knew this is what I can do without getting bored and tired quickly. Over the next year, I worked on multiple small projects in Machine Learning. These projects got me my first internship as a Machine Learning Engineer during the summer vacations of 2019.

During the second half of junior year and the first half of senior year, I worked on a Capstone project while leading a team to develop an AI-based mechanical structure to organize garbage. My responsibility was to create an algorithm that could identify the garbage item using the image and other metadata collected using sensors.

Since then, I have been working with BlueOptima, initially as an intern for the first six months, as a Machine Learning and Data Engineer working on a research problem of detecting Vulnerabilities in the Source Code.


PS: As a hobby, I seldom write fiction and poetry. I am enthusiastic about Businesses and Startups and I recently started a Podcast on the same with a friend called [Let's Discuss Business](https://open.spotify.com/show/7zJO77Ba17NbAAutG7W03L?si=3Q5S0zV-RIGXREnF6qPyRQ).
