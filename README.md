My Story
---

I knew I wanted to be a Software Engineer(plot twist: I first became a Machine Learning Engineer and then founded a company) even before I realized that I would have to cram chemical equations to study Software Engineering at a University. So since my early university days, I taught myself Programming and Data Structures and Algorithms, even before being formally introduced by the University and taking part in competitive programming.

During the summer break after my Sophomore year, I decided to stay back at the University and attend a summer workshop on Machine Learning taken by a professor. Then there was no going back.

I started building incredible Machine Learning Models and Applications around it. Within 45-days of taking the workshop, I cracked into the finals of a Hackathon, which saw ~25 teams in the finals that initially had more than 2200 participants at the start! I knew this is what I can do without getting bored and tired quickly. Over the next year, I worked on multiple small projects in Machine Learning. These projects got me my first internship as a Machine Learning Engineer during the summer vacations of 2019.

During the second half of junior year and the first half of senior year, I worked on a Capstone project while leading a team to develop an AI-based mechanical structure to organize garbage. My responsibility was to create an algorithm to identify the garbage item using the image and other metadata collected using sensors.

My first job was an internship with SourceFuse during the summer break after the third year of the University, where I worked on time-series problems. After that, I secured an opportunity with BlueOptima during a campus placement drive at TIET. At BlueOptima, I worked on Research and Development to detect security vulnerabilities in source code for over nineteen months. Alongside the project, I was responsible for some other small projects, interviewing candidates, and managing the onboarding of some employees in the team.

I knew its time to try my hands on starting something new. To find out the problem I would like to fix, I started a podcast show(Let's Discuss Business) where various businesses and startups were discussed. The idea was that a business-centric podcast would make me research industries and companies that I am not currently involved with and make me stumble on something that needs work. Eventually, the idea worked, and I started HackAcademy.
